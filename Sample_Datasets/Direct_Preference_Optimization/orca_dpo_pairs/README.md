# Notice
This is a sample training and validation file for DPO. This was curated based on the [OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) reference dataset.

## Dataset Summary
The OpenOrca dataset is a collection of augmented FLAN Collection data. Currently ~1M GPT-4 completions, and ~3.2M GPT-3.5 completions. It is tabularized in alignment with the distributions presented in the ORCA paper and currently represents a partial completion of the full intended dataset, with ongoing generation to expand its scope. The data is primarily used for training and evaluation in the field of natural language processing.

## Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The OpenOrca dataset is intended to align with the distributions outlined in the [Orca paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707). It was developed to help generate high quality model checkpoints for NLP researchers and developers.

## Languages

The text in the dataset is in English. The associated BCP-47 code is `en`.
